+ This repository contains some <b>accepted</b> code I (<u>a fresh coder</u>) wrote for problems from a few online judge platforms, namely
  + <b>PKU judge online</b>
  + <b>hihocode</b>
  + <b>bailian on openjudge</b>
  + <b>leetcode</b>

+ Some problems are shared among many platforms, in that case I only place the solution at one place of them.
